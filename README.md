# GOLANG project template

This is my personal [GOLANG](http://golang.org/) project template.
It is built with these goals in mind:

* Everything should be local to the development folder as much as is possible without
  resorting to ugly hacks.

* N-step build without any special setup after any `git clone` on a newly minted machine
  except for installing the `go` compiler itself.

* Do not rely on global `GOPATH` and yet still allows you to check your entire source
  folder in as if you would a normal go program. This makes your repository still plays
  well with other go coders and global `GOPATH` convention.

# Getting Started

Just run these commands or make a script and modify to your liking:

```sh
mkdir your-new-shiny-project    # Make a new shiny folder for your new project.
cd your-new-shiny-project       # Get into the folder first, of course.
git init                        # Or not, doesn't matter.

# Download the scratch template
curl -L https://github.com/chakrit/go-scratch/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xzv --strip 1

git add .
git commit -m "Initialize GOLANG project. (github.com/chakrit/go-scratch)"
```

# Makefile

Everything is done through the `Makefile` for convenience. A wrapper script `./go` is also
provided that invokes `go` with `GOPATH` sets to the local `.go` folder.

Makefile tasks defaults to `test`. The `all` task is simply an alias for the `build`
task. All common tasks you'd do with `go` is given the same name in the Makefile so
`go vet` is, through the Makefile, `make vet` or via the wrapper script `./go vet`.

# Dependencies

Dependencies are automatic thanks to `go get .` automatically scanning your source files
for dependencies. Run `make deps` to explicitly downloads them. Otherwise tasks that
normally requires dependencies to be installed will do them automatically.

I have a few [gorilla toolkit](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/) dependencies in as those
are what I often needs, feel free to fork this project and modify `main.go` to your
liking. Everyone's `main.go` will all be different anyway.

# Sample

Here's a sample output of what happens when you simply cloned this gist and issue `make`:

```
$ make
./go get -d .
./go test .
```

Basically it automatically `go get` any missing dependencies for you and then runs all the
tests in the project.
